<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<p>The mission of eMobilis is to create opportunities for African youth by training them on digital, software and other
    \technologies that prepare them for the future of work by equipping them with marketable, industry driven skills.

    Our goal is to ensure that our talented youth are available and trained in order to meet the growing opportunities
    and needs of the ICT Industry in Africa.

    We also envision an explosion of technology innovation and the creation of successful tech ventures by local
    developers from across the country with a zeal for changing the world through harnessing the power of their
    technology training for social good.</p>
